## Deeper level concepts dealing with JavaScript
BIG WORDS:

#### Syntax Parser: This is simply a program that reads your code and determines if it is valid syntacticly and what it does. 

#### Lexical Environment: Where something physically sits in the code you write.
 
#### Execution Context: A wrapper to help manage the code that is running.
    There are many different lexical environments. Which one is running is managed by execution context. It can contain things beyond what you have written in your code.
    
#### Objects in JavaScript are just name: value pairs
